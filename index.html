    As a styling language, CSS specifies how users view documents, from the layout to the style. The documents affected are typically text files that get structure from a markup language, the most common of which is HTML, however, XML and SVG are also popular. In order to present the document to the user, CSS converts it from the text file into a useable form. With browsers, this presentation occurs on a computer screen, printer or projector.
